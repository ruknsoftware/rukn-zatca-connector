# Tests module for KSA Compliance
# This module is required for Frappe's parallel test runner to work properly in CI
# It provides a minimal interface that satisfies the parallel test runner's requirements

# The parallel test runner expects this module to exist and be importable
# We don't need to import anything specific since the test discovery
# happens through file system scanning, not through this module
